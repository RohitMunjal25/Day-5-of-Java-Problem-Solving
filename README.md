# Day-5-of-Java-Problem-Solving
On the day 5 I learn how to handle files in Java using classes like File, FileWriter, and BufferedReader. This repository contains multiple Java programs that demonstrate essential file handling operations through hands-on examples.
The problems i solved in this repo are following:

1. Demonstrate a Java program with the class name FileHandlingExample to 
perform the following file handling operations: 
i. 
Create a new file named test.txt. 
ii. Write initial content to the file. 
iii. Read and display the content of the file. 
iv. Append additional text to the existing file. 
v. Count and display the total number of words in the file. 
vi. Delete the file. 
2. Write a Java program with the class name Handle6 to create a new file named 
project.txt using the File class. Use proper exception handling with throws 
IOException. Do not write any content to the file — just create the empty file. 
3. Demonstrate a Java program to count the total number of lines and words 
in a text file named notes.txt. 
The program should read the file, iterate through each line, and calculate: 
• Total number of lines 
• Total number of words (consider words separated by spaces). 
Handle exceptions properly in case the file is not found. 
4. Demonstrate a Java program to read a file and display the following 
details: 
• File name 
• File absolute path 
• Whether the file is readable 
• Whether the file is writable 
• File length in bytes 
• Finally, attempt to delete the file and display the status 
Use appropriate methods from the File class to perform these operations. 
Handle the case where the file does not exist.
